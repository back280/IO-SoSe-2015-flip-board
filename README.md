##Abstract motor poster:  

With this documentation I would like to present the results of our last project developed during the summer term at FHP tutored by Fabian Morón Zirfas: 11EG-B Elementares Gestalten - Basics 1.012 Grundlagen Fläche und Struktur
Werkstattpraxis.


##Prerequisite  

For the last project in this term our teacher briefed us with a short prasentation and introduced us into the basic idea:

- Find electrical scrap and hack it.

- Tell a story, a joke or make a statement on a moved, electrical poster

- Translate the human computer interaction (HCI) technically.

- Find a way to hide the electronic devises that drives the motor poster.

- The viewer should activate the motor poster passively. No touch, no obvious buttons.      

So is started to by electronic scrap from 

The main hardware we had to use was the arduino board. A micro controller that is able to drive small stepper motors, led´s and other electronic components.


This is the part where you explain what is needed beforehand to run your project. You can add unordered list with hypens `-` or asteriks `*`.  

- Something in a list unordered
- Something else  
* something with an asteriks  


##Dependencies  

In the dependencies section you can tell the reader what your project relies on. e.g if you are using Python you could write which modules. Or on the Raspberry Pi it would be the packages. Below you see an ordered list.  

1. Ordered list  
2. more things  

##Installation  

Here you tell what should be done to install your project. You could tell him to clone it with git and run some install script or just provide all the code to install all packages on a Raspberry Pi. This should be done in a code block if it is code. You can write code inline by enclosing it in ticks \` ` like this` or you can use 4 whitespaces like in the example below.  

    git clone https://github.com/fabiantheblind/README.git
    cd README

Or for example:  

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-dev python-rpi.gpio

##Usage  

Now here you actually explain how to use your project. This could be some code or maybe just omething like hit "Run" in processing.  

##Something else  

Maybe you have to say something else. This could go here. Did I mention that you can also declare headings? The headings are like in html. You can write them like this:  

    # Heading 1
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    #### Heading 4
    ##### Heading 5
    ###### Heading 6

This will convert to:  

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
